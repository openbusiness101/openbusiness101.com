#### "Plan"

The product of my business is nothing other than how the business is run. And I sell it through membership. Higher tier would get more details, down to the numbers and cash flow.

Simple example, say I start a market survey to understand potential customers. Here are three different levels of details for different level of membership:

- Public report for even non-members will include summary like this, “The survey shows that I over-estimated the customer-base of my business plan. Surprisingly there shows very little interest in the cash-flow report”

- For first-tier member, the report will have details of this survey, including the exact questions I put in the market survey, which tool/platform I use, and an official summary of the survey result from the tool/platform.

- For second-tier member, there’ll be additional information, including how much I spent in this market survey, with detailed breakdowns if there’s any. Also I’ll share the detailed survey reports. In other words, I will share all the paper records, if it’s OK to share.

And the whole business relies on the income from the membership.

The potential customers are those who like to start a business but not in a position to do so, and those who already started a business but like to know how other small businesses run similar tasks in the details. I don't know any similar business with this model, so it seems there's no direct competitor.

According to report like this, there can be millions potential customers in US. Only if I can get a small percentage to be my customer!

My initial price tags are, $5/month to be first-tier member, and $20/month to be second-tier. A wishful first year forecast is to get 200 members on board, one out of five being second tier. That’ll lead to `200*(20%*20+80%*5)=$1600` as monthly revenue.

#### Why

Several reasons I chose this model in the first place about a couple of weeks ago:

- It’s the simplest standalone business I can imagine

- I don’t have any other particularly good product to sell

- It needs relatively little and flexible investments (both time and money) initially

- The business has all the same aspects as all other businesses, including marketing, bookkeeping, budgeting and management, etc.

- I still can take advantage of my experience in web application development

- I like the idea of open source in software world

- Based on my previous experience of side hobby projects, it can’t last long unless I’m a user of the project. And I would love to be a paid user to any similar business (I didn’t know any at that moment).

#### Related Research

Most of below comes from the book “Home Business Tax Deduction 2018”, which I borrowed from local library. Though I started searching with tax in my mind, my focus become the first part of the book, which shows what it takes to be in business, from IRS point of view, which is kind of like minimum requirement, IMO.

So in order to prove to be in business, I’d better have:

- work steadily, anything less than 5-10hours per week would look like a hobby

- good business records, like bookkeeping

- necessary business license/permits

- seek professional services when necessary (mentor, consulting)

- networking with related organizations and associations

- create website

- business checking account, cards, letterheads; separate phone line

There are also things I’ve never heard of before, that I’m so glad to know before I actually start a business. Like start-up expenses before the business formally starts can be tax-deductible. I realize a better execution plan even before the business starts is worthwhile.

Start-up expenses include all below:

- operating expenses like office rent, telephone service, utilities, office supplies, equipment rental and repairs

- market research (yeah)

- advertising costs before business opens (yeah!)

- costs for employee training

- to obtain financing supplies/distributor

- licenses/permits/fess

- fees paid to lawyer, accountant, consultant and other professional services

The biggest news for me is, it’ll be a big commitment to run a home business. And I’d better prepare for it. The big question is, what shall I do if I want to formally start the business this year. With this question in mind, together with a lot others, I made an appointment with a local business mentor program, hoping to get some advice.
