As mentioned in the end of last post, I requested for an appointment with [SCORE](https://siliconvalley.score.org/) as I took a session a while ago from them. Fortunately I got appointment on Mar 7th. I got a lot of valuable advice and guidance. Outline below:
- there are opportunities to network with people who want to be business owners
- there are many classes organized by SCORE on various aspects of running business
- better to know the customers/market more before putting down anything serious

After the session, I made up my mind to join a [group](https://www.advancedj.com/) as paid VIP member, to access both contents with limited access, and chatting rooms that's only accessible for VIP members. I got some advice from there as well, and I realized some difficulties that I might overlook. This is the first non-trivial money investment I put into the idea.
