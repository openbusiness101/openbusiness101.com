I’m currently a full time software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. The thought of becoming a business owner may start from my teenage years when I heard that “only if I had started a business myself” from my parents. As you can imagine, my parents became too occupied with all things in their lives and that phrase stayed as a phrase ever since. Now does not seem to be perfect timing in my life to start a business, but I don’t think there will ever be that kind of moment. Last but surely not the least, I just got the legal status that’s required to start business in the US. This project will be my baby steps towards a business owner.

I had graduate degree in computer science, and took some classes in business finance and management in graduate program. After graduation I volunteered in a small business to help with some book keeping and budgeting tasks. By no means I’m expert in any area of business, and I’m looking forward to seeing how far I can go, with some ideas of getting help in the next section.
