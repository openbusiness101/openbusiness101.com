#### What's This?

I'm starting my first business, and you are welcome to see it inside-out and have a say.

I'll show exactly how it runs, and even details of cash flow.

No matter if you are a new business owner, or just thinking of starting a business, this is a great real-world case study, as you will find all the common aspects of every business, like marketing, accounting and managing, and most importantly, the startup spirit.

Rough ride ahead. Buckle up, and let's go!

#### About me

I’m currently a full time software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. The thought of becoming a business owner may start from my teenage years when I heard that “only if I had started a business myself” from my parents. As you can imagine, my parents became too occupied with all things in their lives and that phrase stayed as a phrase ever since. Now does not seem to be perfect timing in my life to start a business, but I don’t think there will ever be that kind of moment. Last but surely not the least, I just got the legal status that’s required to start business in the US. This project will be my baby steps towards a business owner.

I had graduate degree in computer science, and took some classes in business finance and management in graduate program. After graduation I volunteered in a small business to help with some book keeping and budgeting tasks. By no means I’m expert in any area of business, and I’m looking forward to seeing how far I can go, with some ideas of getting help in the next section.
